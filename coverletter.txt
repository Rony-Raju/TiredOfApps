To whom it may concern:
I am writing in response to the prospect of joining this company. I am a recent graduate of the

technology industry. I am hoping to gain more experience while contributing to this company and my field.

My experience working with a development team is about a year. You will find that I have a great thirst
for knowledge and an aptitude for learning new things. One of my best abilities is to create and carry
out ideas that accomplish goals in unique ways. My goals in applying to this position is to grow more as a

cementing my place in the industry as a member of the work force.

Sincerely,
